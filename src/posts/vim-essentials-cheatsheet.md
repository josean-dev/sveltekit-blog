**Tip**: Use `:nohl` after a search to temporarily turn off search highlights until another search command is used.

## Navigating The Jump List

### Context

Certain vim movements that move the cursor several lines away will add entries to the **jumplist**. You can display the **jumplist** with `:jump`.

Common commands that will add entries to the jumplist: `G`, `gg`, `[number]G`, `/`,`?`, `n`, `N`, `%`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `:s`, `L`, `M`, `H`. Navigating to a different file/buffer in the same window also works.

**IMPORTANT**: `[number]j` and `[number]k` will not add entries to the jumplist.

For a complete list of commands that add entries to the jumplist use `:h jump-motions`.

_I use this often to navigate from and to different buffers/files in the same window._

| Command  | Description                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl-O` | Go to the previous cursor position in the jump list |
| `Ctrl-I` | Go to the next cursor position in the jump list     |

# Editing Text

_Now that you know how to move within Vim, editing text will go hand in hand with Vim movements._

**Note**: A `{motion}` is a Vim command that moves the cursor. Like many of the commands described in the previous section.

## Deletion

| Command      | Description                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `d{motion} ` | Delete the text that the `{motion}` command moves over and copy into register. |
| `dd`         | Delete whole current line and copy into register.                              |
| `D`          | Delete from under the cursor to the end of the line and copy into register.    |

**Tip**: You can also use a `{number}` before these commands to execute the deletion that `{number}` of times.

### Some Examples

| Example | Description                                                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dw`    | Delete from cursors current position to start of next **word** |
| `de`    | Delete from cursors current position to end of **word**        |
| `dG`    | Delete from cursors current position to end of file            |
| `d]}`   | Delete from cursors current position to next unmatched `}`     |
| `2dd`   | Delete whole line under cursor and line below it.              |

_The possible combinations are endless..._

## Undo & Redo

| Command  | Description                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `u`      | Undo last change                            |
| `Ctrl-R` | Redo changes that have been undone with `u` |

**Tip**: You can also use `{number}` before these undo & redo commands to execute it that `{number}` of times.

## Changing Text

**Note**: Executing a change command with `c` is pretty much the same as `d` except that it takes you into insert mode afterwards.

| Command      | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `c{motion} ` | Delete the text that the `{motion}` command moves over, copy into register and enter insert mode. |
| `cc`         | Delete whole current line, copy into register and enter insert mode.                              |
| `C`          | Delete from under the cursor to the end of the line, copy into register and enter insert mode.    |

Examples would be the same as with delete but changing `c` to `d`.

## Repeating a File Change

| Command | Description                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `.`     | Repeat the last change you made to the file |

**Tip**: You can use `{number}` before `.` to repeat the change that `{number}` of times.

_This is a really nice one!_

## Replacing & Deleting Characters

**Note**: When executing, substitute `{character}` with an actual character.

| Command        | Description                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `r{character}` | Replace current character under cursor with `{character}`                          |
| `R`            | Enter replace mode and start replacing characters by typing until `ESC` is pressed |
| `x`            | Delete current character under the cursor and copy into register                   |

**Tip**: You can use `{number}` before `r` and `x` to execute that `{number}` of times.

## Yank (Copy) and Paste (Put)

| Command     | Description                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `y{motion}` | **Yank** or copy text that the motion command moves over into register         |
| `yy`        | **Yank** or copy whole current line into register                              |
| `Y`         | **Yank** or copy from under the cursor to the end of the line into register    |
| `p`         | **Put** or **paste** the text found in register (register x) after the cursor  |
| `P`         | **Put** or **paste** the text found in register (register x) before the cursor |

**Tip**: You can use `{number}` before `y` or `p` to repeat the **yank** (copy) or **put** (paste) command that `{number}` of times.

**Note**: Commands such as `d`, `c` and `x` mentioned above also copy text into a register. These as well as the `y` command copy into register x by default.

## Changing Case

| Command      | Description                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~`          | Switch case of character under cursor and move cursor to the right  |
| `~{motion}`  | Switch the case of the text that the `{motion}` command moves over  |
| `gu{motion}` | Change the text that the `{motion}` command moves over to lowercase |
| `guu`        | Make whole current line lower case                                  |
| `gU{motion}` | Change the text that the `{motion}` command moves over to uppercase |
| `gUU`        | Make whole current line upper case                                  |

## Search/Replace

| Command          | Description                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `:%s/old/new/g`  | Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new" in whole file                          |
| `:%s/old/new/gc` | Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new" in whole file, asking for confirmation |
| `:%s/old/new/gi` | Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new" in whole file, ignoring case           |

## Working With Text Objects and Inside/Around 🚀

_I personally love using this feature!_

You can use Vim text objects to execute an operator on that object or select it with Visual mode (Use `v` to enter visual mode).

First, here's a list of handy text objects to remember.

### Text Objects To Remember

| Object       | Description                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `a"`         | A double quoted string, including the quotes                           |
| `i"`         | A double quoted string, excluding the quotes                           |
| `a'`         | A single quoted string, including the quotes                           |
| `i'`         | A single quoted string, excluding the quotes                           |
| `a(` or `a)` | A block surrounded by parenthesis, including the parenthesis           |
| `i(` or `i)` | A block surrounded by parenthesis, excluding the parenthesis           |
| `a[` or `a]` | A block surrounded by brackets, including the brackets                 |
| `i[` or `i]` | A block surrounded by brackets, excluding the brackets                 |
| `a{` or `a}` | A block surrounded by curly braces, including the curly braces         |
| `i{` or `i}` | A block surrounded by curly braces, excluding the curly braces         |
| `a<` or `a>` | Text surrounded by `<>`, including the opening `<` and the closing `>` |
| `i<` or `i>` | Text surrounded by `<>`, excluding the opening `<` and the closing `>` |
| `at`         | A block surrounded by xml/html tags, including the tags                |
| `it`         | A block surrounded by xml/html tags, excluding the tags                |
| `aw`         | A **word** including the surrounding whitespace                        |
| `iw`         | A **word** excluding the surrounding whitespace                        |
| `ap`         | A **paragraph** including the surrounding whitespace                   |
| `ip`         | A **paragraph** including the surrounding whitespace                   |

### How to use text objects

To use text objects, place the cursor anywhere inside one and type an `{operator}` followed by the `{text object}` to execute the operator on that object.

**Tip:** Think of 'a' as **around** and 'i' as **inside**.

### Examples

| Command | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `diw`   | Delete word that cursor is in, keeping surrounding whitespace (Think: "delete inside word")                                               |
| `daw`   | Delete word that cursor is in as well as surrounding whitespace (Think: "delete around word")                                             |
| `di(`   | Delete everything within parenthesis surrounding cursor, keeping the surrounding parenthesis (Think: "delete inside parenthesis")         |
| `da(`   | Delete everything within parenthesis surrounding cursor as well as the surrounding parenthesis (Think: "delete around parenthesis")       |
| `di"`   | Delete everything within double quotes surrounding cursor, keeping the surrounding double quotes (Think: "delete inside double quotes")   |
| `da"`   | Delete everything within double quotes surrounding cursor as well as the surrounding double quotes (Think: "delete around double quotes") |
| `dit"`  | Delete everything within tags surrounding cursor, keeping the surrounding tags (Think: "delete inside tags")                              |
| `dat`   | Delete everything within tags surrounding cursor as well as the surrounding tags (Think: "delete around tags")                            |

Of course these examples from above can be applied to other operators like `c` or `y` for changing, copying, etc... or using `v` instead of an operator to select the text object in visual mode.

## Indentation

| Command     | Description                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `>{motion}` | Indent text that the `{motion}` command moves over, to the right |
| `>>`        | Indent whole current line to the right                           |

**Tip**: You can use `{number}` before `>` and `>>` to execute the indentation that `{number}` of times. For example, use `2>>` to indent the current line and the line below it.
**Tip # 2**: You can also use **text objects** with `>`
